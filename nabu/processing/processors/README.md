# Processors

A processor is used to process data in the data preperation script. For example,
feature computation for audio or normalization for text. To create a new
processor you should inherit from the general Processor class defined in
processor.py and overwrite the abstract methods. You should then add it to the
factory method in processor_factory.py and to the package in \_\_init\_\_.py.
