- MERL_DC_statereset_2spk: statereset LSTM DeepClustering recipe for 2 speakers for wsj-2spk (here called MERL_2spk)
- MERL_DC_statereset_ivec10_2spk: statereset LSTM DeepClustering recipe for 2 speakers where the oracle i-vectors 
(extracted from single speaker speech) are appended to the input. 

- MERL_DC_statereset_then_full_2spk: statereset only on first layer, second layer unconstrained
